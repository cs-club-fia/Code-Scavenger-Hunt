{
  "question1": "Agent 401, the satellite signal repeats itself in layers. Start from the smallest number and climb back up. Each level hides a small number, but the top of the tower reveals the real key.",
  "question2": "The Phantom likes to leave traps in file names. Even-numbered files reveal their first letter, odd-numbered files their second-to-last. Only by picking the correct letters will the next door unlock.",
  "question3": "The Phantom sabotaged the log script. Watch the lines carefully — one part checks length, another picks a letter. Fill the blanks correctly, or the code will self-destruct!",
  "question4": "This labyrinth is deceptive. Some letters are shadows, some numbers are decoys. Only the pattern of every third element reveals the true message. Remember, even indices hide secrets.",
  "question5": "The Phantom scattered their identity across all your previous keys. Look at the edges, skip the decoys, and collect only what's meaningful. Every character matters."
