Mission 2 - Ciphered Agent Files

Story:
Phantom left encrypted agent file names. Only by picking letters carefully will the next door unlock.

Code:
```python
files = ["omega", "theta", "zeta", "kappa", "lambda"]

key_sequence = []
for f in files:
	if len(f) % 2 == 0:
		key_sequence.append(f[1].upper())
	else:
		key_sequence.append(f[-2].upper())

print("".join(key_sequence))
```

Task:
Trace the loop and conditionals to determine the printed string. This is the key for Mission 2.

Answer: AETDL

Spy-Themed Hint:
"The Phantom likes to leave traps in file names. Even-numbered files reveal their first letter, odd-numbered files their second-to-last. Only by picking the correct letters will the next door unlock."
