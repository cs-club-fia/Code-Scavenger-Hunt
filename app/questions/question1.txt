Mission 1 – The Recursive Signal

Story:
Phantom sent a looping signal from an abandoned satellite. Decode the numeric key hidden in its pattern.

Code:
```python
def signal(n):
	if n <= 1:
		return 2
	return n * signal(n-1) - n + 1

for i in range(1, 6):
	print(signal(i))
```

Task:
Trace the recursive function for n = 1 → 6 and predict `signal(6)`. This is the key for Mission 1.

Answer: 721

Spy-Themed Hint:
"Agent 401, the satellite signal repeats itself in layers. Start from the smallest number and climb back up. Each level hides a small number, but the top of the tower reveals the real key."
