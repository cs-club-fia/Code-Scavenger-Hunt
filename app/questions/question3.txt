Mission 3 - Fill-in-the-Blank Debugging

Story:
Phantom sent a partially corrupted script. Some lines are missing — only by filling the blanks correctly will you extract the next key.

Code (Fill in ___):
```python
agents = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]
for a in agents:
	if len(a) > ___:
		print(a[___].upper(), end="")
	else:
		print(a[___].upper(), end="")
```

Task:
Fill in the blanks, run the code, and trace the output. This is the key for Mission 3.

Answer:
Blanks: 3, 0, -1

Output: RLEG

Spy-Themed Hint:
"The Phantom sabotaged the log script. Watch the lines carefully - one part checks length, another picks a letter. Fill the blanks correctly, or the code will self-destruct!"
