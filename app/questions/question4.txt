Mission 4 - The Nested Labyrinth

Story:
Phantom left scrambled codes in a digital labyrinth. Only by analyzing nested loops, conditionals, and slicing can you extract the hidden message.

Code:
```python
codes = ["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta"]
hidden = []

for i, c in enumerate(codes):
	for j in range(len(c)):
		if j % 2 == 0:
			hidden.append(c[j].upper())
		else:
			hidden.append(str(j))
		if j == len(c) - 1:
			hidden.append("-")

message = hidden[::3]
print("".join(message))
```

Task:
Trace the nested loops, track what goes into `hidden`, apply slicing `[::3]`, and determine the output. This is the key for Mission 4.

Spy-Themed Syntax Hints:
enumerate(codes) -> Gives both the index and the agent code, like reading a dossier with file numbers.

if j % 2 == 0 -> Even positions hide keys; odd ones are traps.

append() -> Add each discovered clue to your encrypted notebook.

hidden[::3] -> Every third element hides a secret - skip the decoys.

Spy-Themed Hint:
"This labyrinth is deceptive. Some letters are shadows, some numbers are decoys. Only the pattern of every third element reveals the true message. Remember, even indices hide secrets."
